## About me
I'am 25 year's old. I studied at Gomel State Techical University in 2014/2019. Now I work as a hydraulic design engineer in Minsk. I work with 3D model and drawings. 
I started programming on JavaScript about 1 year before, but I had little progress and I paused a bit. After that I found one intresting channel on YouTube, which told me about Frontend development. I started search education courses and found "Frontend developer" course by Skillbox. I start learn HTML and CSS. In Udemy I found Javascript course and I'am studing it now.
My best-friend told me about RS School and I decided to start ones for develop my skills. I hope it will usefull for me and I can change my life.
